# Competitive Programming Algorithms in C++

## Goal
Here I want to post all standard code that I used to solve problems in Online Judges and Competitions.  
All codes will be in C++11.

## Organization
I chose divide the algorithms in 6 big groups.
* Computational Geometry
* Data Structure
* Graph
* Math
* Paradigms
* String

## How to use
Download the code that you want and compile it using this:

g++ codeName.cpp -o code -std=c++11
